# Stock Trading Training App

Welcome to the Stock Trading Training App! This application aims to help users learn and practice stock trading using real historical stock prices. The app comprises two primary components:

- **Backend:** A FastAPI-based Python API responsible for fetching and delivering historical stock prices.
- **Frontend:** A React web application where users can conduct paper trading with random stocks.

> This project is unique, with the majority of its code generated by an **AI Coding Assistant (Aider)**. AI-assisted coding, often referred to as pair programming with AI, represents the future of software development. This engaging and intricate project serves as a valuable opportunity to test the capabilities of the AI Coding Assistant.
